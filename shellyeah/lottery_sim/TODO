[X] *.. Create projects homepage that will link to all projects
[ ] *** Create lottery sim page.
        X Take in league number
        X Create webpage to select/modify default lottery odds
                X This should pull team names and records prior and create/display ordered list.  
                X Pull records from each team
                        - May need to drop last X # of games for playoffs.
        X Run lottery code.
        X Update lottery code so that only the bottom 5 teams are included in the lottery.
                X Currently the split odds function will split the odds in a black box.
                X If the 5th and 6th teams are tied, the odds will be split between the 2, grouping the 6th team into the lottery.
                X Tiebreaker goes to higher points for, then higher points against.  Need to pull this info too when updating DB. 
        X Create lottery template and output results of lottery simulation
        - Create animation loading screen
        - Quick draw/skip button
        - Update so when user inputs league_id, the league info is updated from Sleeper's API. 
        - Assosiate team name with display name incase no team_name was set. 
                - Ex. youwaremetobed is the display_name but a team name was not set so None was displaying on website. 
[ ] **. Create hashing algorithm for the combinations.  
        - Currently, lottery sim is O(n^2) since we loop through teams and use 'in'
        - Hash will allow for O(1)
[X] *** Create a players page which will list a players in nba
        X Create players model for DB
        - Create a scheduled task to pull from API to update once a week
[ ] *** Create new template for the following:
        - League info
        - Trade tracker
        - My team info (i.e record, points scored, best lineup)
[ ] *.. Waaaay down the line lineup predictions using ML.
