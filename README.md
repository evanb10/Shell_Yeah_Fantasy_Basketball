ShellYeah! Fantasy Basketball
Overview
ShellYeah! Fantasy Basketball is a web application designed to enhance the fantasy basketball experience for leagues hosted on Sleeper. While Sleeper provides a robust fantasy sports platform, its fantasy basketball support is somewhat limited. This project aims to fill in the gaps by providing additional tools to assist in league management—starting with a draft lottery simulation and expanding toward more advanced features like in-depth player stats, trade analyzers, and more.

Features
✅ Player List: Displays all NBA players currently tracked by Sleeper.
✅ League Selection & Draft Lottery: Users can enter their Sleeper username, retrieve their leagues, and simulate a draft lottery based on the previous season’s standings.
✅ Odds Customization: The draft lottery odds can be manually adjusted, provided they sum to 100%.
✅ Automated API Integration: The app interacts with Sleeper’s API to fetch real-time fantasy league data.

How It Works
Navigate to the Lottery Simulation Tool

Click the 'Lottery Sim' option under the 'Projects' dropdown in the navbar.
Enter Your Sleeper Username

The backend fetches your unique user_id via Sleeper’s API.
Select Your League

A list of all your active NBA fantasy leagues is displayed.
Choose one to proceed.
Generate Draft Lottery Odds

The backend retrieves last season’s league data to determine team records.
These records automatically set the draft lottery odds, but you can modify them as long as they total 100%.
Run the Lottery Simulation

Click 'Submit' to simulate the draft lottery and determine the draft order for bottom teams.
Tech Stack
Django 4.2.13 (Web Framework)
Python 3.10.12
whitenoise 6.6.0 (Serving static files)
Sleeper API (Fantasy league data source)
Requests Library (Handling API interactions)
Data Handling
League Data Source: All league data is fetched from Sleeper’s API via a custom-built Python script using the requests library.
Local Database Storage: Once retrieved, league data is stored locally to allow for additional calculations and insights without repeatedly querying Sleeper’s API.

Who Is This For?
This project is designed for fantasy basketball managers using Sleeper who want more control and insights into their leagues. It also serves as a showcase of my backend development skills, particularly in API integration, database management, and Django web development.
